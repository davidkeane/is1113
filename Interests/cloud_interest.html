            <h2><b>What is Cloud Computing?</b></h2><br><p>In cloud computing the cloud is used as a metaphor for "the Internet," so the phrase cloud <br> computing 
            means a type of Internet-based computing, where different services are delivered to an organization's computers and <br> devices through the Internet.

Cloud computing is an on-demand service that has obtained mass appeal in corporate data centers. The cloud enables the data center to operate like the Internet and computing resources to be accessed and shared as virtual resources in a secure and scalable manner. Like most technologies, trends start in the enterprise and shift to adoption by small business owners.</p>

        	<p>
        	    Cloud computing is extrememly useful to me as a student for a number of reasons. It protects my work from being lost as it is not stored in one particular location <br>
        	    and can be accessed from anywhere. This allows me to access work that I have done in college when I get home to work on on my laptop.

        	<div class="section" id="section3"><h2><b>My favourite Cloud Service:</b></h2><br><p>Google Drive is a personal cloud storage service from Google that lets users store and synchronize digital content across computers, laptops and mobile devices. 
        	Google Drive allows me to store photo's and other data online without taking up storage on my phone or computer. It also allows me to access my data from anywhere on any device. <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/"><u>Click here to visit Google Drive.</u></a></p>
