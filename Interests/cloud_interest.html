        I like cloud computing it is great !

        	 <h2>Cloud Services</h2>
        <p>The term 'cloud services' encapsulates a broad range of web-based technologies that can take the place
        of traditional methods in terms of storage, development enviroments and software. The primary types of Cloud Services
        are <a href="../ebusiness/ebushomepage.html">Software as a Service</a>, <a href="../ebusiness/ebushomepage.html">Platform as a Service</a>, 
        <a href="../ebusiness/ebushomepage.html">Infrastructure as a Service</a> and <a href="../ebusiness/ebushomepage.html">Communication as a Platform.</a>
        The use of the term 'cloud' to describe these virtualised IT resources came about as cloud was used as a metaphor for the Internet
        and a standardised cloud-like shape was used to denote a network on telephony schematics.</p>
        <p>Cloud services have been used to make this project almost in it's entirety, as I used Cloud 9, a Platform as a Service, to develop my site along with
        Github, an example of Software as a Service to host my project, and finally Heroku, another Platform as a Service to deploy my website. This is in place of 
        the more traditional method of writing code in a downloadable program such as Notepad and storing the files locally. Our use of several cloud services as part of this
        project has greatly strengthened my interest in the topic andit has also highlighted their growing importance and use in development.</p>

    <h2>Why use Cloud Services</h2>
    <p>Using cloud services provides many benefits in terms of cost, time efficiency, maintenance and security. The method of payment
    for a cloud service is pay-per-use, meaning the user only has to pay when they actually want to utilise the service. Also, as the user does not
    actually purchase the infrastrucure, the maintenance of it and the cost associated with this is solely the responsibilty of the vendor. I'm greatly
    interested in expanding my use of cloud services following this project as the benefit of being able to access saved content remotely far outweighs that
    of storing files locally on my computer. A great service in my opinion also is <a href="https://www.google.com/docs/about/">Google Docs</a>, a word processor that works very similar to Microsoft Word but with the 
    added advantage of being entirely cloud based and simply connected to my Google account.</p>
